# maframe
Maframe is a simple mvc-based php framework. initially I use for my own projects but over time here I share and may be useful for us all

## Server Reqruitments

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
